Software developer with product vision, passionate about solving problems and creating the best user experiences.  
Driven to continuously learn and adapt to new technologies, I like to deliver high‑quality solutions.  
Over my **7 years of experience**, I have had the opportunity to contribute to the creation of projects from scratch, as well as to the maintenance
and redesign of established projects in agile teams of about ten people.
